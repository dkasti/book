### Using the code

- (Default option) ipynb files (for JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook and VScode): download the .ipynb files and open them on your Jupyter environment. If "%matplotlib" causes an error, find the right graphics backend that works for you. To see a list of available backends on your machine, type matplotlib -l
- py files (for IDLE, Spyder, Pycharm etc.): Each folder contains a subfolder called ".py files". Download the .py files and run. For Spyder, set graphics backend to automatic (look under preference>IPython console>graphics backend).
